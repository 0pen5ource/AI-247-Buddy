  What is AI247?

  AI247 (Buddy) is a privacy-first productivity companion for macOS that acts like a supportive friend who helps you stay focused and productive
  throughout your day.

  How it works:

  ðŸ§  Smart Activity Tracking - Monitors which apps you use and gently categorizes your activities (deep work, distractions, meetings) without
  sending data anywhere.

  ðŸ¤– Local AI Coaching - Two AI personas provide timely interventions:
  â€¢ Alex (The Coach): Warm, empathetic, celebrates your wins
  â€¢ Jordan (The Firm): Accountability partner who keeps you honest

  âš¡ Timely Interventions - Detects when you're:
  - Struggling to start tasks (rapid app-switching)
  - Getting distracted for too long
  - Hyperfocusing beyond healthy limits
  - Context-switching excessively

  ðŸ“… Visual Time Planning - Drag-and-drop timeline for planning your day with energy-aware task scheduling and "Must-Do" task commitment.

  ðŸŽ® Gamification - Earn XP, unlock achievements, build streaks, and activate power-ups to make productivity feel rewarding.

  Research-Backed Techniques:
  âœ… Flowtime (flexible focus sessions for ADHD brains)
  âœ… Implementation Intentions ("When X, I will Y")
  âœ… Temptation Bundling (pair hard tasks with rewards)
  âœ… Energy Management (ultradian rhythms)
  âœ… Commitment Devices (streak protection)


  Privacy-First Design:
  ðŸ”’ All data stays on your Mac (uses local Ollama AI)
  ðŸ”’ No cloud sync, no accounts, no tracking
  ðŸ”’ Open source and fully transparent

  Perfect for:
  - ADHD professionals who need gentle accountability
  - Deep workers who want to optimize focus
  - Anyone tired of productivity apps that feel like punishment

  Built with Swift/SwiftUI. Requires macOS 13.0+ and Ollama (free, open-source).
